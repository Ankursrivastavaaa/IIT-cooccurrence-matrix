Data
• Consider the data file provided to you (Will be uploaded)

• Each row of the file is a sentence. Whitespace characters separate the words

• Read the data file to create a Boolean matrix 𝐷where

• 𝐷𝑖𝑗is 1 if and only if sentence 𝑖contains word 𝑗
• Use LA operations to create the word cooccurrence matrix 𝐶where
• 𝐶𝑖𝑗should store the number of sentences in which both 𝑖and 𝑗are present


Exploration
• Discuss the following in a report:
• Word level statistics for the overall data
• Distribution of sentence lengths
• Distribution of cooccurrence counts
• Any other observations from the data
• If you are using Python, you can use linear algebra packages, and packages
	for file reading, data handling, plotting packages. Do not use any package
	for handling this specific nature of the input data (unless you are
	performing extra tasks e.g. stemming).
